# Cricket-Analytics-IPL-Dataset
Indian Premier League (referred to as IPL) is an annual cricket tournament that is conducted every year in the Indian subcontinent. The objective of this project is to analyze the IPL tournament data set and to generate insights for teams based on their performances at different venues. The major part of the project involves analyzing the data collected over the past nine seasons of IPL from 2008 to 2016 and explore insights that are not commonly perceived. The performance of teams across venues and across time is analyzed using tools like SQL, R and Tableau. Finally, a summary of the analysis is also presented as per the findings from the analysis.
